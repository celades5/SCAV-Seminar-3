# SCAV-Seminar-3
Seminar 3 for SCAV subject at UPF

**Teacher:** Javi Fernandez

Tis readme intents to explain the second lab in the SCAV subject for the video part.

This repository consists in:

**Pdf:** Pdf file containing screenshots of exercises with results. Plus a link in the header to the *git repository*.

**Python exercises:** Containing the code for all the different exercises needed to compute this lab. Run *ex4* containing the menu of all the lab for a full experience. Run each exercise independently if desired.

**ex1:** We are going to carry out the procedure of transforming the videos to VP8, VP9, ​​h265 and AV1 with a single video, in our case it will be 480p called *bbb_480.mp4*. To do the others it would be the same procedure that we implmented for the first convertion. To transform it we will follow the indications of *https://trac.ffmpeg.org.*

For the convertion to specific types, we have followed this guides from the ffmpeg website.

-   **VP8** &rarr; *https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/VP8*

-   **VP8** &rarr; *https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/VP9*

-   **VP8** &rarr; *https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.265*

-   **VP8** &rarr; *https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/AV1*

As we can see in the **pdf file**, the video have been transformed into the outputs specified.
